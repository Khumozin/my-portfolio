An enthusiastic technical professional with a complete understanding of the entire software development lifecycle.

As a software developer with over **7 years of experience**, I have developed a strong expertise in Angular, Nx Monorepo, TypeScript, Javascript, Cypress (E2E Automation), Jasmine (Unit Testing), and DevSecOps. I am passionate about building scalable and maintainable software solutions that solve real-world problems.

## Work experiences:

Things I've worked on:

- Build standalone Angular libraries
- Application runtime performance optimizations
- Code architecture improvements
- Code modernization with latest Angular features
- Migrating legacy apps to Angular app
- Unit and E2E testing Angular apps
- Release Management (Semantic Versioning)
- CI/CD Pipelines

Using Angular with a variety of libraries and other frameworks like Electron, NgRx, Angular Material, NgBootstrap, Tailwind CSS, .Net, Node.js, and more, targeting all platforms including iOS, Android, Desktop apps, etc,. is something I'm very familiar with.
